Recently, I came across one of the trello's job listings. To
apply, one has to solve a small puzzle and send an email with
a "magic word" in subject. I think it works a better fizz-buzz
test.

While I was having a coffee break, I wrote a simple solver in
JS. It was fun. While it's easy to solve that puzzle for any
developer, I just wanted to share it.
